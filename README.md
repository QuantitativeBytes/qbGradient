# qbGradient

		qbGradient is a simple implementation of the gradient descent method for
		numerical optimization, intended to demonstrate the principles of the
		method for educational purposes.
		
		The code utilizes function pointers so that the user can specify an
		external object function to be minimized that can take any form over
		any number of variables.
		
		The code is intended to be studied along side the corresponding videos
		on the QuantitativeBytes YouTube channel. The specific videos relating
		to this code may be found here:
